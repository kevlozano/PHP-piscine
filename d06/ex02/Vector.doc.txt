<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class the placement of points in space and even give
them a simple color. It uses orientation of right hand.

An instance can be constructed using the class of Vertex and Color.

The attributes needed are x, y, z and (optionally) w (set at 0 by default). Also,
by using the 'orig' (optional) key you can determine the origin of the vector, 
which is set at 0,0,0 by default.

The attributes are private but can be seen by using the method getX(), getY(), getZ()
getW().

The class provides the following methods :

Vector  magnitude();
Returns the magnitude of the new instance of Vector

Vector  normalize();
Returns ta new instance of Vector with a Vertex classed of normalized magnitude

Vector  add($rhs);
Returns the addition of the new instance of Vector and Vector rhs

Vector  sub($rhs);
Returns the substraction of the new instance of Vector and Vector rhs

Vector  dotProduct($rhs);
Returns the dot product of the new instance of Vector and Vector rhs

Vector  opposite();
Returns the opposite of the new instance of Vector

Vector  scalarProduct($k);
Returns the scalar product of the new instance of Vector and scalar k

Vector  add($rhs);
Returns the addition of the new instance of Vector and Vector rhs

Vector cos($rhs);
Returns the angle’s cosine between both vectors.

Vector crossProduct($rhs);
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors
